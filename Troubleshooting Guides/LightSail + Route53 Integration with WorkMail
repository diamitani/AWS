Troubleshooting Guide: Specific Issue with gptpat.com (Route 53 and WorkMail)

Overview
This guide recaps the troubleshooting process for resolving a DNS configuration issue with the domain gptpat.com after transferring it from GoDaddy to AWS Route 53. The domain worked with Amazon Lightsail but not with Amazon WorkMail due to a nameserver mismatch between the registered domain and the hosted zone.

Problem
Symptoms: Domain gptpat.com resolved correctly for Lightsail but failed to work with WorkMail.
Root Cause: The nameservers listed under "Registered domains" in Route 53 (ns-1060.awsdns-04.org, etc.) did not match the nameservers in the hosted zone for gptpat.com (ns-318.awsdns-39.com, etc.), breaking DNS authority for WorkMail records.

Steps Taken
Identified Nameserver Mismatch:
Registered domain nameservers:
ns-1060.awsdns-04.org
ns-338.awsdns-42.com
ns-1662.awsdns-15.co.uk
ns-819.awsdns-38.net
Hosted zone nameservers:
ns-318.awsdns-39.com
ns-913.awsdns-50.net
ns-2044.awsdns-63.co.uk
ns-1366.awsdns-42.org

Conclusion: The registered domain wasn’t pointing to the hosted zone managing DNS records.

Updated Nameservers:
In Route 53 "Registered domains," changed the nameservers for gptpat.com to match the hosted zone’s:
ns-318.awsdns-39.com
ns-913.awsdns-50.net
ns-2044.awsdns-63.co.uk
ns-1366.awsdns-42.org
This aligned the domain’s authority with the hosted zone containing DNS records.

Verified Hosted Zone Records:
Checked the hosted zone for gptpat.com (using ns-318, etc.) for:
A/ALIAS record for Lightsail (ensuring it persists post-fix).
Missing WorkMail records (MX, TXT, CNAME).

Added WorkMail DNS Records:
In the hosted zone, added:
MX: 0 gptpat-com.mail.protection.outlook.com
TXT: v=spf1 include:amazonses.com ~all
CNAME: autodiscover.gptpat.com → autodiscover.mail.us-east-1.awsapps.com (region-specific).
Removed any conflicting GoDaddy-era records if present.

Tested Propagation:
Used nslookup -type=NS gptpat.com to confirm new nameservers propagated.
Used nslookup -type=MX gptpat.com to verify WorkMail MX records.

Validated WorkMail:
In WorkMail console, verified gptpat.com domain status changed to "Verified" after DNS updates.
Tested email functionality via WorkMail web client.

Resolution
Updated the registered domain’s nameservers to match the hosted zone, ensuring Route 53 had full authority over gptpat.com.
Added WorkMail-specific DNS records and confirmed propagation, resolving the email issue.

Notes
Propagation may take 1-48 hours; monitor with nslookup or mxtoolbox.com.
If Lightsail stops working post-fix, re-add its A/ALIAS record to the hosted zone.
